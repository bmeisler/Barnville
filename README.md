# Barnville
Most of the code I used to create the game "Farmville" for Addicting Games. See the full game here: http://www.addictinggames.com/funny-games/farmland-game.jsp

I used existing code for the path finding and the isotile making, from a Friends of Ed book - I did not include that in this repo.

Nonetheless, this is still an ineresting code sample as it uses some pretty sophisticated design patters, including Model Locator and Command.
