# Barnville
Most of the code I used to create the game "Farmville" for Addicting Games. It's in Actionscript, but it's still pretty cool. See the full game here: http://www.addictinggames.com/funny-games/farmland-game.jsp

I used existing code for the path finding and the isotile making, from a Friends of Ed book - I did not include that in this repo.

Nonetheless, this is still an interesting code sample as it uses some pretty sophisticated design patterns, including Model Locator, MVC and Command.

I "dumbed down" this game from an iso-based multi-player online game engine I built using the SmartFox engine. In that version, there were multiple rooms, and multiple players could be in any one room, move from room to room, and live chat with other players. Available for demo on request.
